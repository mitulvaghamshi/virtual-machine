## Tasks

1. Startup the (Microsoft Windows Server) virtual machine, and sign on to the Guest OS using the administrator account's security credentials.

2. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, change the IP address settings from a dynamic configuration to a static configuration.

- Use the IP address of (`10.10.10.10`) and a subnet mask of (`255.255.255.0`).

3. Startup the (Microsoft Windows) virtual machine, and sign on to the

- Guest OS using the localuser account's security credentials.

4. On the (Microsoft Windows) Guest OS, change the IP address settings from a dynamic configuration to a static configuration.

- Use the IP address of (`10.10.10.15`), a subnet mask of (`255.255.255.0`), and a DNS server address of (`10.10.10.10`).
- Verify network connectivity between the (2) Guest OSes.

5. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, install the (DNS Server) server role.

- You will also want to retain the local SAM database for the node **AND AT THE SAME TIME**.

6. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, install the (Web Server(IIS)) server role.

- Install the server role using its default role services.
- The (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS is now a "multi-roled" node.
- It is capable of providing the following services on the network:
  - DNS
  - Web Server
- Both the (DNS) and (Web Server) server roles require the node to have a static IP address.
- You cannot configure these services on a node that is configured to receive its IP address settings dynamically.

7. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, verify all services configured to automatically start up are in a running state.

8. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, create a new DNS reverse lookup zone for the following IPv4 network:

- Network #1: `10.10.10.0`

9. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, create new DNS forward lookup zones for the following DNS namespaces:

| No. | DNS Namespace         |
| --- | --------------------- |
| #1  | `pet-rescue.org`      |
| #2  | `creativedesigns.net` |
| #3  | `xyzsports.co.uk`     |

10. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, configure the DNS server such that each of the host-full and host-less FQDNs (located on the next slide) resolve to their associated IPv4 address.

- Ensure you create the appropriate (PTR) resource records for the reverse lookup zone when you are creating the (Host (A)) resource records.
- Hint: Not all of the forward lookup zone resource records you create will be of type (Host (A)).
- Some of the resource records will be of type (CNAME).

| Domain Name                     | IP Address    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `pet-rescue.org`                | `10.10.10.50` |
| `www.pet-rescue.org`            | `10.10.10.50` |
| `adoption.pet-rescue.org`       | `10.10.10.51` |
| `creativedesigns.net`           | `10.10.10.52` |
| `www.creativedesigns.net`       | `10.10.10.52` |
| `catalogue.creativedesigns.net` | `10.10.10.53` |
| `xyzsports.co.uk`               | `10.10.10.54` |
| `www.xyzsports.co.uk`           | `10.10.10.54` |
| `equipment.xyzsports.co.uk`     | `10.10.10.55` |
| `purchase.xyzsports.co.uk`      | `10.10.10.55` |
| `rentals.xyzsports.co.uk`       | `10.10.10.55` |

11. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, bind the following additional IP addresses and subnet masks to the node's network adapter:

| No. | IP Address    | Subnet Mask     |
| --- | ------------- | --------------- |
| #2  | `10.10.10.50` | `255.255.255.0` |
| #3  | `10.10.10.51` | `255.255.255.0` |
| #4  | `10.10.10.52` | `255.255.255.0` |
| #5  | `10.10.10.53` | `255.255.255.0` |
| #6  | `10.10.10.54` | `255.255.255.0` |
| #7  | `10.10.10.55` | `255.255.255.0` |

12. On the (Microsoft Windows) Guest OS, verify all (7) IP addresses bound to the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS are responsive.

- Use the (`ping`) utility to complete this task.

13. On both the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS and the (Microsoft Windows) Guest OS, use the (`ping`) utility to confirm all of your new DNS entries are resolving correctly.

- On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, create a (`C:\Data`) folder in order to begin centralizing the data needed for your web sites.
- On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, below the (`C:\Data`) folder, create the following (3) folders:
  - `pet-rescue.org`
  - `creativedesigns.net`
  - `xyzsports.co.uk`

14. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, below the (`C:\Data\pet-rescue.org`) folder, create the following (2) folders: www adoption

15. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, below the (`C:\Data\creativedesigns.net`) folder, create the following (2) folders: www catalogue

16. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, below the (`C:\Data\xyzsports.co.uk`) folder, create the following (4) folders: www equipment purchase rentals

17. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, create a generic HTML document called (`index.html`) immediately below the (`C:\Data`) folder.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Site Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>FQDN</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

18. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, make a copy of the (`C:\Data\index.html`) document into each of the following folders:

```console
C:\Data\pet-rescue.org\www
C:\Data\pet-rescue.org\adoption
C:\Data\creativedesigns.net\www
C:\Data\creativedesigns.net\catalogue
C:\Data\xyzsports.co.uk\www
C:\Data\xyzsports.co.uk\equipment
C:\Data\xyzsports.co.uk\purchase
C:\Data\xyzsports.co.uk\rentals
```

19. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, modify each of the copied (`index.html`) documents, such that they show something unique when rendered in a web browser.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Site Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>adoption.pet-rescue.org</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

- Each site-specific web page will be transmitted back to the client's web browser, where it will be rendered.
- These web pages will be used to confirm that each of your web sites is correctly configured.
- To make each HTML document unique and meaningful, type in the FQDN value between the heading tags.
- When the HTML document renders in a web browser, you will be able to quickly confirm if you have visited the correct web site (or not).

20. Create (8) new Microsoft IIS-based web sites for each provided URL; the associated web page should render in the client web browser application.

- All web sites are to be "unsecured", using the (http) protocol, and responding on port (`80`).

| DNS Namespace         | URL                                     | Rendered Web Page                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `creativedesigns.net` |                                         |                                                    |
|                       | `http://pet-rescue.org/`                | `C:\Data\pet-rescue.org\www\index.html`            |
|                       | `http://www.pet-rescue.org/`            | `C:\Data\pet-rescue.org\www\index.html`            |
|                       | `http://adoption.pet-rescue.org/`       | `C:\Data\pet-rescue.org\adoption\index.html`       |
| `xyzsports.co.uk`     |                                         |                                                    |
|                       | `http://creativedesigns.net/`           | `C:\Data\creativedesigns.net\www\index.html`       |
|                       | `http://www.creativedesigns.net/`       | `C:\Data\creativedesigns.net\www\index.html`       |
|                       | `http://catalogue.creativedesigns.net/` | `C:\Data\creativedesigns.net\catalogue\index.html` |
| `pet-rescue.org`      |                                         |                                                    |
|                       | `http://xyzsports.co.uk/`               | `C:\Data\xyzsports.co.uk\www\index.html`           |
|                       | `http://www.xyzsports.co.uk/`           | `C:\Data\xyzsports.co.uk\www\index.html`           |
|                       | `http://equipment.xyzsports.co.uk/`     | `C:\Data\xyzsports.co.uk\equipment\index.html`     |
|                       | `http://purchase.xyzsports.co.uk/`      | `C:\Data\xyzsports.co.uk\purchase\index.html`      |
|                       | `http://rentals.xyzsports.co.uk/`       | `C:\Data\xyzsports.co.uk\rentals\index.html`       |

21. On the (Microsoft Windows) Guest OS, use the Microsoft Edge web browser application to test all (8) web sites, using the (11) provided URLs.

- Clear the Microsoft Edge web browser's cache when needed (especially if you are navigating to the same web site again after a configuration change has been made on the server).
- Ensure all (11) provided URLs (for the 11 "unsecured" web sites) render their correct web page within the Microsoft Edge web browser application.
