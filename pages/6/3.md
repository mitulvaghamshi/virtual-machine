# Managing a DHCP Server

- DHCP services are a necessity for all networks.
- Without it, administrators (or users) would have to manually enter the static IP address settings for each of the nodes they work with.
- Imagine if you had to re-type the IP address settings on your smartphone each time it were connected to a different network.
- Managing a DHCP server involves:
  - Creating one or more DHCP scopes.
  - Verifying IP address settings are being issued out to DHCP clients successfully.
  - Monitoring the DHCP scope and ensuring the scope does not run out of IP addresses.

## DHCP Scopes

- A DHCP scope defines:
  - A pool (group) of IP addresses which are issued out to DHCP clients.
  - A lease time which identifies how long a DHCP client may use an issued IP address for.
  - A subnet mask that is associated with each issued IP address.
  - A default gateway address, so that DHCP clients can access other networks.
  - A DNS server address, so that DHCP clients can resolve hostnames and FQDNs to IP addresses.
  - A DNS namespace suffix, used to create FQDN values when only a hostname is queried.

## Installing the (DHCP Server) Server Role

1. Similar to (AD DS) and (DNS), select the (DHCP Server) server role and complete the installation process.

2. Complete the post-installation configuration requirement for the (DHCP Server) role.

- Nothing to change along the way in most cases.
- Just use the default settings.

![](../../img/6/3.img-2.webp)

3. Click "Next”.

![](../../img/6/3.img-3.webp)

4. Click “Commit."

![](../../img/6/3.img-4.webp)

5. Click “Close."

![](../../img/6/3.img-5.webp)

6. Once the (DHCP Server) post-installation configuration requirement has completed, don't forget to clear out the "Server Manager's" notification area.

- The notification area contains reminders for you to do something, so keeping this area clear, visually informs you that there is nothing else for you to do.

## Creating a DHCP Scope

7. The "DHCP" interface is used to manage all aspects of your DHCP environment.

![](../../img/6/3.img-7.webp)

8. Right-click on the (IPv4) node, and select the "New Scope..." option.

- A wizard will guide you through the process for creating a new DHCP for your network.

![](../../img/6/3.img-8.webp)

9. Click “Next."

![](../../img/6/3.img-9.webp)

10. Enter a descriptive name for your new DHCP scope.

- The value can be anything you like.

![](../../img/6/3.img-10.webp)

11. Enter the range of IP addresses for your pool.

- These are the IP addresses which will be issued out to your DHCP clients on the network.
- A valid subnet mask needs to be identified, so that all DHCP clients will participate in the same IP network.

![](../../img/6/3.img-11.webp)

12. On rare occasions, it may be necessary to remove a few IP addresses from the previously defined pool of addresses (e.g. statically configured nodes which use IP addresses which are part of the pool).

- If you define your IP networks properly from the start, then there should be no need to exclude any IP addresses from the pool.

![](../../img/6/3.img-12.webp)

13. Define the DHCP scope's lease time.

![](../../img/6/3.img-13.webp)

14. The extra options include the (default gateway, DNS server, DNS namespace suffix, etc.) setting values.

![](../../img/6/3.img-14.webp)

15. Add the default gateway for the IP network.

![](../../img/6/3.img-15.webp)

16. Add a DNS server for the IP network.

- The DNS namespace suffix can be left alone or modified if you wish.

![](../../img/6/3.img-16.webp)

17. Another example of "old technology" which should be deprecated.

- Only older nodes (e.g. Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0, etc.), and older software rely on WINS (Windows Internet Name Services) to resolve hostnames to IP addresses.
- Modern networks all use DNS services for name resolution purposes.

![](../../img/6/3.img-17.webp)

18. Activate the new DHCP scope so that DHCP clients can begin to acquire their IP settings dynamically from the DHCP service on your network.

![](../../img/6/3.img-18.webp)

19. Click "Finish”.

## Microsoft Windows DHCP Clients

20. Once DHCP services are available on your network, other nodes can be configured to acquire their IP settings dynamically.

![](../../img/6/3.img-20.webp)

21. Manually verify all IP setting values (IP address, subnet mask, default gateway address, DNS server address, DNS namespace suffix, etc.) were acquired from the DHCP service.

```console

## Oracle Linux DHCP Clients

23. Use the (`ifconfig`) command to verify the node has received a valid IP address and associated subnet mask from your DHCP service.

```console

24. Use the (`cat /etc/resolv.conf`) command to view the contents of the node's name resolution configuration file.

- This file is automatically updated when the node is configured as a DHCP client.
- Here, we see both the DNS server address and DNS namespace suffix are correct, with values we expect for them.

```console
[root@ol000123456a ~]# cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Generated by NetworkManager
search ad000123456a.com
nameserver 10.0.10.20
[root@ol000123456a ~]#
```

25. Test connectivity on the network and name resolution from your DNS service to ensure all is working properly.

```console
[root@ol000123456a ~]# ping -c 2 creativedesigns.net

```

26. Use the (`route -n`) command to identify the default gateway for the node.

- The value should match what you defined earlier when you created the DHCP scope.

```console
[root@ol000123456a ~]# route -n

## Identifying DHCP Clients

27. Now that we have a couple of nodes on our network utilizing the DHCP scope we created, let's see who they are.

- As it is with most Microsoft graphical interfaces, you will need to manually refresh the applicable node (folder) before it is populated with current information.

![](../../img/6/3.img-27.webp)

28. And, as expected, we see that there are (2) nodes on our network that have acquired their IP settings from our DHCP service.

![](../../img/6/3.img-28.webp)

## Managing a DHCP Scope

29. Once a DHCP scope has been created, it can be modified and monitored.

- Here you can view the IP address pool range, or modify it (make it bigger or smaller) if needed.

![](../../img/6/3.img-29.webp)

30. Here, you can see which nodes have acquired their IP address settings from this DHCP scope.

- Currently, (2) nodes on the network are configured dynamically for their IP address settings.

![](../../img/6/3.img-30.webp)

31. If you need to add or change the options for the DHCP scope, here is where you can do so.
