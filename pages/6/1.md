## Tasks

1. Start the (Microsoft Windows Server) virtual machine, and sign on to the Guest OS using the administrator account's security credentials.

2. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, change the IP address settings from a dynamic configuration to a static configuration.

- Use the IP address of (`10.0.10.20`) and a subnet mask of (`255.255.255.0`).
- On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, bind the following additional IP addresses and subnet masks to the node's network adapter:
  - IP Address #2: `10.0.10.21` Subnet Mask #2: `255.255.255.0`
  - IP Address #3: `10.0.10.22` Subnet Mask #3: `255.255.255.0`
  - IP Address #4: `10.0.20.20` Subnet Mask #4: `255.255.255.0`
  - IP Address #5: `10.0.30.20` Subnet Mask #5: `255.255.255.0`
  - IP Address #6: `10.0.40.20` Subnet Mask #6: `255.255.255.0`

3. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, verify all (6) IP addresses are responsive by using the (`ping`) utility.

4. Promote the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS to an Active Directory Domain Controller.

- Ensure Active Directory is customized for your environment.
- Use your personal 9-digit number for the Active Directory Forest name, the Root Domain name, and the older NetBIOS reference for the domain.
- Once the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS has restarted, verify all services configured to automatically start up are in a running state.

5. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, create new DNS reverse lookup zones for the following IPv4 networks:

- Network #1: `10.0.10.0`
- Network #2: `10.0.20.0`
- Network #3: `10.0.30.0`
- Network #4: `10.0.40.0`

6. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, create new DNS forward lookup zones for the following DNS namespaces:

- DNS Namespace #1: `pet-rescue.org`
- DNS Namespace #2: `creativedesigns.net`
- DNS Namespace #3: `xyzsports.co.uk`

7. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, configure the DNS server such that each of the host-full and host-less FQDNs resolve to their associated IPv4 address:

- pet-rescue.org `10.0.20.20`
- www.pet-rescue.org `10.0.20.20`
- sales.pet-rescue.org `10.0.20.20`
- hrdept.pet-rescue.org `10.0.20.20`
- creativedesigns.net `10.0.30.20`
- www.creativedesigns.net `10.0.30.20`
- engineering.creativedesigns.net `10.0.30.20`
- catalogue.creativedesigns.net `10.0.30.20`
- xyzsports.co.uk `10.0.40.20`
- www.xyzsports.co.uk `10.0.40.20`
- equipment.xyzsports.co.uk `10.0.40.20`
- purchase.xyzsports.co.uk `10.0.40.20`

8. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, use the (`ping`) utility to confirm all of your new DNS entries are resolving correctly.

- Start the (Microsoft Windows) virtual machine, and sign on to the Guest OS using the localuser account's security credentials.
- On the (Microsoft Windows) Guest OS, change the IP address settings from a dynamic configuration to a static configuration.
- Use the IP address of (`10.0.10.30`), a subnet mask of (`255.255.255.0`), a preferred DNS server address of (`10.0.10.20`), and a default gateway address of (`10.0.10.20`).
- Verify network connectivity between the (2) Guest OSes.

9. On the (Microsoft Windows) Guest OS, verify that each of the host-full and host-less FQDN values (located on the previous slide) resolve to their associated IPv4 address.

- Use the (`ping`) utility to complete this task.

10. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, install the (DHCP Server) server role.

- The (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS is now a "multi-roled" node.
- It is capable of providing the following services on the network:
  - Active Directory
  - DNS
  - DHCP
- All (3) of the above services require the node to have a static IP address.
- You cannot configure these services on a node that is configured to receive its IP address settings dynamically.

11. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, create a DHCP scope using the following information.

- Use the default values for all other settings that are not explicitly listed below:
  - Scope Name: `My New Scope`
  - Scope IP Address Range: `10.0.10.100` - `10.0.10.149`
  - Subnet Length: 24 bits
  - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
  - Default Gateway: `10.0.10.20`
  - DNS Server: `10.0.10.20`
  - Lease Time: 8 days

12. On the (Microsoft Windows) Guest OS, change the IP address settings from a static configuration to a dynamic configuration.

- Verify you have received a valid IP address, subnet mask value, default gateway address, and DNS server address from the DHCP server.
- Verify network connectivity between the (2) Guest OSes.

13. On the (Microsoft Windows) Guest OS, purge the client-side DNS cache.

14. On the (Microsoft Windows) Guest OS, verify that each of the host-full and host-less FQDN values (located on slide #9) resolve to their associated IPv4 address.

- Use the (ping) utility to complete this task.

15. Startup the (Oracle Linux) virtual machine and sign on to the Guest OS using the root account's security credentials.

- Verify you have received a valid IP address, subnet mask value, default gateway address, and DNS server address from the DHCP server.
- Verify network connectivity between all (3) Guest OSes.

16. On the (Oracle Linux) Guest OS, verify that each of the host-full and host-less FQDN values (located on slide #9) resolve to their associated IPv4 address.

- Use the (ping) utility to complete this task.

17. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, confirm that the (2) nodes have acquired their IP settings from the DHCP scope you defined earlier.
