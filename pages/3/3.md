10. On the (Microsoft Windows - 2) Guest OS, share the (`C:\Data\Sales Department`) folder with a share name of (`Sales`).

- Ensure user (`john.smith`) will have Full Control access to the (`Sales`) shared folder.

11. On the (Microsoft Windows - 1) Guest OS, map a network drive to the new shared folder hosted on the (Microsoft Windows - 2) Guest OS.

- The UNC pathname will be similar to (`\\w000123456b\Sales`).
- Modify to fit your virtualized environment.

12. On the (Microsoft Windows - 1) Guest OS, copy the local (`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`) text-based file across the network and into the (`Sales`) shared folder.

13. On the (Microsoft Windows - 2) Guest OS, verify the (hosts) file now exists in the (`C:\Data\Sales Department`) folder.

28. On the (Microsoft Windows - 1) Guest OS, attempt to map a network drive to the (`HRDept`) shared folder hosted on the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS.

- Verify user (`john.smith`) is no longer able to successfully map a drive to this folder, as his SAM-based account on the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS has since been disabled.

29. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, disable the sharing of the (`C:\Data\Human Resources`) folder.
