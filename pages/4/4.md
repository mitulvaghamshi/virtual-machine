## Tasks

1. Startup the (Microsoft Windows Server) virtual machine, and sign on to the Guest OS using the administrator account's security credentials.

2. On the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS, change the IP address settings from a dynamic configuration to a static configuration.

- Use the IP address of (`10.25.128.22`) and a subnet mask of (`255.255.0.0`).

3. Startup the (Microsoft Windows) virtual machine, and sign on to the Guest OS using the localuser account's security credentials.

4. On the (Microsoft Windows) Guest OS, change the IP address settings from a dynamic configuration to a static configuration.

- Use the IP address of (`10.25.164.127`) and a subnet mask of (`255.255.0.0`).

5. Verify network connectivity between the (2) Guest OSes.

6. Promote the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS to an Active Directory Domain Controller.

- Ensure Active Directory is customized for your environment.
- Use your personal 9-digit number for the Active Directory Forest name, the Root Domain name, and the older NetBIOS reference for the domain.
- Once the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS has restarted, verify all services configured to automatically start up are in a running state.

7. Create a new Active Directory organizational unit container off the root of the domain.

- Organizational Unit Name: Sales Department

8. Create a new Active Directory user account below the (Sales Department) organizational unit container.

- Username: `john.smith`
- Password: `P&ssw0rd`

9. On the (Microsoft Windows) Guest OS, authenticate using the new Active Directory user account (`john.smith`).

- Ensure you authenticate using the newer, more modern UPN reference for the user account, and not the older, outdated NetBIOS reference for the user account.
- Use: `john.smith@ad000123456a.com`
- Not: `AD000123456A\john.smith`

10. Create (2) additional Active Directory user accounts, and authenticate as them using the (Microsoft Windows) Guest OS.

- User # 2
  - Department: `Human Resources`
  - Full Name: `Anna Taylor`
  - Password: `P&ssw0rd`
- User # 3
  - Department: `Information Technology`
  - Full Name: `Carl Bailey`
  - Password: `P&ssw0rd`
- Gracefully shut down the (Microsoft Windows) Guest OS.
- Gracefully shut down the (Microsoft Windows Server) Guest OS.
- For both virtual machines, remove each virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) file from the Oracle VirtualBox Virtual Media Manager repository.
- Do not delete either of the virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) files.
- Remove both virtual machine profiles.
- Delete all virtual machine configuration files.
