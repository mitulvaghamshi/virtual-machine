## Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

- The majority of business networks do not make use of SAM user accounts and security groups for authentication and authorization purposes.
- This method would be very inefficient, extremely insecure, and a complete nightmare to maintain.
- Instead, a directory service is utilized.
- A directory service is used for many things, including the centralization of user accounts and security groups.
- A directory service has a database back-end, which is usually distributed and/or replicated across the network.
- This is for both efficiency and redundancy purposes.
- For Microsoft environments, Microsoft provides a directory service called Microsoft Active Directory, or simply "Active Directory."
- For non-Microsoft environments (e.g
- Apple macOS, Linux, etc.), LDAP directory services are available.
- LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.
- LDAP is very similar to Active Directory.

## Active Directory Terminology

- Active Directory Environment - A general term referring to all components of Active Directory within the network environment, and not just one specific component.
- Active Directory Forest - The main construct of an Active Directory environment.
- Immediate subcomponents of a forest include Active Directory Domains.
- Typically, the forest is named after the top-level DNS namespace for a company (e.g. acme.com).
- Active Directory Domain - A collection of common Active Directory objects (e.g. user accounts, security groups, computers, etc.), which are logically grouped together and managed similarly.
- For example, in a larger company, the (Sales Department) may have its own Active Directory domain called (sales.acme.com).
- Likewise, the (Human Resources) department may have its own Active Directory domain called (hr.acme.com).
- Active Directory Root Domain - The very first domain created within a new forest.
- The root domain name and associated forest name are identical.
- Organizational Units - Logical containers which are used to provide a level of organization to the various objects within Active Directory.
- Folders - Are built-in logical containers within Active Directory, used to group common default system objects (e.g. Users, Computers, etc.).
- Administrators cannot manually create folder containers within Active Directory.
- They are created automatically by other software as needed.

## Microsoft Active Directory Domain Controllers

- Nodes running a Microsoft Windows Server operating system build the backbone of an Active Directory environment.
- Nodes configured to maintain components of Active Directory are called Active Directory Domain Controllers.
- In order to create an Active Directory Domain Controller, the network administrator must activate software on the node and then promote it to a domain controller.
- This is a two-step process.
- Active Directory is installed on a node by adding the Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) server role (and associated role services) using the (Server Manager) application.
- Once a node has been promoted to an Active Directory Domain Controller, the local SAM database on the node is completely deleted.
- DNS services must be present on the network before Active Directory can be activated.
- Active Directory relies on DNS services.

## User and Group Management

- User account and security group management is performed using an interface called Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC).
- The (Computer Management) applet is only used to manage user accounts and security groups that belong to a SAM database.

## Placement of Active Directory Objects

- A common mistake when creating Active Directory objects is to locate them in a single common organizational unit container or their default container (e.g. Users, Computers, etc.).
- Grouping all objects in a single container makes administration near impossible.
- Locating a specific user account in Active Directory, where there are many thousands of objects, would take time.
- Managing security on all the objects would be difficult, as there is no clear separation between them (e.g. Sales department employees versus Human resources employees).
- It is wise to create organizational unit hierarchies and group the objects (user accounts, security groups, etc.) in the container that best fits (e.g., all sales department user accounts are placed within a common "Sales" organizational unit).

## Authenticating with Active Directory

- Once Active Directory is up and running within the network environment, the centralized user accounts can then be used to authenticate on the network.
- Microsoft Windows nodes and Microsoft Windows Server nodes must be individually added into Active Directory before any user can authenticate from them.
- This process is called: joining a domain.
- Nodes that are not joined to an Active Directory domain cannot be used for authentication purposes.
