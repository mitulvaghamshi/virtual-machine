# Roles and Responsibilities

- Software developers are responsible for creating applications.
- Software developers create applications by writing programmatic code which adheres to one or more programming languages.
- Network administrators are responsible for deploying traditional applications in the workplace, on each of the user nodes.
- Network administrators are also responsible for creating the environment in which web applications get deployed and run.
- It is important to understand and respect the responsibilities associated with each role (software developer, network administrator) in the workplace.

## Application Development

- The majority of new application development in the workplace is web applications.
- Web applications (web apps) are hosted centrally in a web application environment (the combination of: web servers, application servers, database servers, etc.).
- Traditional application development involves creating standalone applications which are then installed on each user node.
- A redistributable installation package is typically used to install applications on the user nodes.
- Redistributable installation packages contain most (if not all) of the required software dependency components needed to successfully execute (run) each application.
- The (2) classes of traditional applications are:
  - **Console applications**: Applications which execute in a command line environment.
  - **GUI applications**: Applications which present the user with a graphical interface.
- Traditional applications execute their programmatic statements (programming code) on each client node individually.
- Web applications execute their programmatic statements (programming code) on the server and send well-formed web page content (HTML, images, etc.) back to the user's web browser, where it is rendered.
- No additional software dependencies need to be installed on a client node for a web application to execute.
- Only a web browser application is required, making web applications ideal for the masses (compared to traditional applications).
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide a GUI interface for developing both traditional applications and web applications.
- IDEs are more than just a text editor.
- IDEs provide additional integrated features such as: code completion, a compiler, debugging tools, packaging tools, etc., everything in one place for a software developer to be productive.

## Application Programming Languages

  - Maintained By: Microsoft Corporation
    - Visual C#
    - Visual Basic
    - Visual C++
  - Maintained By: Oracle Corporation
    - Java
  - Maintained By: Apple Corporation
    - Swift
    - Objective-C
  - Other notable application programming languages include:
    - C
    - C++
    - Assembly Language
    - Python
    - PHP
    - Ruby

## IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)

- Popular IDEs used for application development include:
  - Maintained By: Microsoft Corporation
    - Visual Studio
  - Maintained By: Oracle Corporation
    - NetBeans
  - Maintained By: Apple Corporation
    - Xcode
  - Other notable IDEs include:
    - Eclipse

## Application Development Cycle

- When developing applications, the following steps take place (in order):
  - Install a suitable IDE.
  - Create a project within the IDE.
  - Write programming code (source code).
  - Build the project (compile into an executable application).
  - Test the application (run, debug, troubleshoot).
  - Create a redistributable package for the application.
  - Deploy the application (install on client nodes or an application server).
  - Update (make changes to the application, and then re-deploy).

## Projects and Solutions

- A project is a collection of source code, icons, images, data files, etc., within the IDE, which comprise an application.
- Specific to the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE, a solution is a grouping of one or more projects and includes supporting metadata (settings, build information, preferences, configuration details, etc.).

## Hello World App

- When one first attempts to develop traditional applications and web applications, a "Hello World" type of application is initially created.
- This is an application that will display the string "Hello World" at the command line level (console applications), in a window (GUI applications), or in a web browser (web applications).
- Developing a "Hello World" type of application familiarizes the software developer with the entire application development cycle before they move on to develop larger, more complex applications.
- A "Hello World" type of application will also verify if supporting software components (software dependencies) are available on the target nodes (where the application will run).
- If not, then the application will fail to run properly or at all.

## Java Applications

- Java applications are compiled into a bytecode format using the (javac) compiler executable.
- A Java application's bytecode is then executed using the (java) executable.
- The (java) executable creates an instance of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), an area in the node's memory where the Java application's bytecode (programming code) is executed.
- When the Java application terminates (finishes executing), the JVM in memory is destroyed.
- To simply run a Java-based application, a user needs to have the (java) executable on their node.
- To develop a Java-based application, a user would need to have both the (javac) and (java) executables on their node.
- One executable used to compile their source code into bytecode format, and one executable used to run their application.
- Files containing the source code for a Java application have a filename extension of (`*.java`).
- Files containing the compiled bytecode for a Java application have a filename extension of (`*.class`).

## Installing Java

- The (java) executable, and supporting files, become available once the
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installation package is installed on the user's node.
- The (javac) executable, and supporting files, become available once the
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installation package is installed on the user's node.
- The JDK comes bundled with the JRE.
- As a Java application developer, one would only need to install the JDK.

## Java Editions

- For developing traditional applications, using the Java programming language, the Standard Edition (SE) of the JDK is required.
- For developing web applications, using the Java programming language, the Enterprise Edition (EE) of the JDK is required.
- The (EE) edition of the JDK is the (SE) edition, with a few "extras‚Äù.
- Most notably, the (EE) edition comes bundled with an application server.
- A Java application server is a software product which is capable of hosting and executing Java-based web applications.
- Apache Tomcat will be used as the platform to host and execute Java-based web applications.

## Java Redistributable Packages

- When it is time to deploy Java-based applications on user nodes or on application servers, a redistributable package is created (typically from within the IDE).
- A redistributable package contains all of the files related to the application.
- The following filename extensions are associated with Java-based redistributable packages:
  - (`*.jar`): Java Application Archive
    - Used to contain all files related to a traditional console application or GUI application.
  - (`*.war`): Web Application Archive
    - Used to contain all files related to a Java web application
