# Virtual Machines

- Virtual Machining is a very popular technology used today, both in the workplace and for personal use.
- The biggest benefit to working with virtual machines is the ability to run multiple host operating systems on a single physical computer system simultaneously.
- The native operating system installed directly on the physical computer system is referred to as the **Host OS**.
- All other operating systems, running within separate virtual machines, are each referred to as a **Guest OS**.
- Each Guest OS has access to the Host OS' hardware resources (processor, memory, network adapter, etc.).
- The Host OS' hardware resources are presented to each Guest OS as virtualized hardware components.

## Virtualization Usages

- Common usages of virtualization include:
  - Creating small networked environments.
  - Creating software development environments.
  - Learning to work with software products where separate dedicated computer systems are not available.
  - Testing out new software products or software product updates.
  - Installing and testing your custom-written applications (computer programs) on a non-development computer system.
- Creating back-end environments used in the testing of mobile applications.

## Virtualized Hardware

- Hardware which you want to make available to a Guest OS is defined in a virtual machine configuration profile.
- Typical hardware that is virtualized and presented to a Guest OS includes:
  - CPUs (one or more processors).
  - Memory.
  - Graphics Adapter.
  - Sound Card
  - Keyboard
  - Mouse
  - Storage Devices (virtual hard disks)
    - To store the Guest OS' operating system, applications, and data
  - Optical Storage Devices (virtual CD/DVD-ROM drives)
    - Used to install the operating system and other software products from an installation media source (e.g. CD/DVD ISO file)
  - Network Adapters
    - Used to communicate with the Host OS, other Guest OSs, and the Internet

## Virtual Network Adapters

- Bridged
  - Configured with an IPv4/IPv6 address, just like a real physical network adapter
  - Can communicate on the network, just like any other physical network device
  - Can communicate out to the Internet
- NAT (Network Address Translation)
  - Configured with a special reserved IPv4/IPv6 address
  - Can communicate with other devices beyond the Host OS, including the Internet
  - By default, cannot be communicated with by other Guest OSs running on the same physical host
  - By default, cannot be communicated with by other hosts anywhere on the network
- Internal Network
  - Used to create small isolated network environments
  - Requires an arbitrary logical network name (e.g. intnet), common to all Guest OSs communicating in the same small network
  - Cannot communicate with the Host OS
  - Cannot communicate with (or be communicated by) other hosts anywhere on the network
  - Cannot communicate with other Guest OSs which are not configured to use the same logical network name (e.g. intnet)
  - Cannot communicate out to the Internet
- Host-only
  - Can communicate with the Host OS
  - Can communicate with other Guest OSs configured with the same network adapter type (Host-only)
  - Cannot communicate beyond the Host OS, including the Internet
