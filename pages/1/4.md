# Guest OS Installation (Microsoft Windows 10)

## Installation Highlights

- Create a virtual machine configuration profile.
- Boot from installation media and install the Guest OS operating system.
- Disable the firewall software service, set the correct time zone, etc.
- Change the Guest OS hostname.
- Update the operating system to the most available stable build.
- Bug fixes, additional features, security patches, etc.
- Install the VirtualBox Guest Additions.
- Install a 3rd party rich-featured text editor.
- Activate the operating system with Microsoft Corporation's license servers.
- Shutdown the Guest OS and back up the virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) file.

1. Click on the "New" button to begin the creation of a new virtual machine configuration profile.

![](../../img/1/4.img-1.webp)

2. Assign a meaningful name for the new virtual machine configuration profile.

- Identify the correct type, version, and build (or as close as possible) for the Guest OS (operating system) being installed.

![](../../img/1/4.img-2.webp)

3. Assign an appropriate amount of the Host OS' physical memory for the Guest OS to use.

- Type in a value of (2048).
- A gigabyte of memory is equal to 1024 megabytes.
- Therefore, this Guest OS will be able to consume up to (2 GB) of the Host OS' physical memory.
- Assigning more memory to the Guest OS is better, but be careful not to leave the Host OS with too little, or it will perform poorly.

![](../../img/1/4.img-3.webp)

4. A new virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) file will need to be created.

- The (`*.vdi`) file is where the operating system and applications are installed.
- Think of a (`*.vdi`) file as a separate hard disk, which is attached to a virtual machine (instead of a physical computer).

![](../../img/1/4.img-4.webp)

5. Use the native virtual disk format for the Oracle VM VirtualBox platform.

- The remaining formats listed are for other virtualization platform products (e.g. VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, etc.).

![](../../img/1/4.img-5.webp)

6. Allow the virtual disk image to start off small in size and grow as needed.

- Although this option can negatively affect the performance of the Guest OS, it is typically suggested so you don't accidentally consume all of the available space on your portable USB-powered storage device.

![](../../img/1/4.img-6.webp)

7. Allow the virtual disk image file to grow to a maximum of (300 GB).

- Don't worry, it won't get close to that in size, but you want to make sure you never run out of room (typical if using the given default size).
- Click on the folder icon and identify a folder on your portable USB-powered storage device where you want this new (`*.vdi`) file to be created.

![](../../img/1/4.img-7.webp)

8. The wizard does a good job of creating the virtual machine configuration profile, but there are additional settings which need to be made.

- With the new virtual machine configuration profile selected (highlighted by the colour blue), click on the "Settings" button.

![](../../img/1/4.img-8.webp)

9. Configure the virtual machine for bidirectional clipboard capability.

- Once the Guest Additions are installed onto the Guest OS, you will be able to (cut+copy+paste) data between the Host OS and the Guest OS.

![](../../img/1/4.img-9.webp)

10. The days of floppy disks are long gone.

- There is no need to configure a virtual machine to support older and unused hardware, so deselect it.
- Also, change the boot order for a typical configuration.

![](../../img/1/4.img-10.webp)

11. Aside from memory, one of the best settings to increase is the amount of virtual CPUs associated with the virtual machine.

- A value above (1 CPU) will increase the performance of the Guest OS significantly.
- The maximum number of (8 CPUs) above is the sum of all CPU cores and hyper-threading features of the CPUs on this physical host computer system.

![](../../img/1/4.img-11.webp)

12. Many of the Guest OSes you create or use throughout your program will make use of a graphical desktop.

- So that all applications function properly (within the Guest OS), make certain you assign the maximum amount of video memory for each virtual machine configuration profile you create.

![](../../img/1/4.img-12.webp)

13. At a minimum, this is what you want all of your virtual machine configuration profiles to look like ...from a storage perspective.

- At least one virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) file and a virtual optical CD/DVD-ROM storage device, connected to the newer and faster SATA storage controller.

![](../../img/1/4.img-13.webp)

14. Next, associate the operating system installation media with the virtual optical CD/DVD-ROM storage device.

- Click on the CD/DVD icon, and select the "Choose Virtual Optical Disk File..." option.

![](../../img/1/4.img-14.webp)

15. Locate and click on the DVD ISO image file you downloaded earlier.

- This is what the virtual machine will initially boot from, in order to install the Guest OS' operating system into the virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) file.

![](../../img/1/4.img-15.webp)

16. Ensure the installation media is associated with the virtual optical CD/DVD-ROM storage device, or you won't be able to boot your virtual machine successfully.

![](../../img/1/4.img-16.webp)

17. The installation of the Guest OS will need Internet connectivity, and without having to use a dedicated IPv4 address.

- The NAT adapter will satisfy this requirement.

![](../../img/1/4.img-17.webp)

18. With the virtual machine configuration properly configured, click on the "Start" button to boot the virtual machine, and begin the operating system installation process.

![](../../img/1/4.img-18.webp)

## Installing the Operating System

19. Boot the virtual machine with the Microsoft Windows 10 DVD ISO associated with the virtualized CD/DVD-ROM storage device.

- Click on the "Next" button to continue.

![](../../img/1/4.img-19.webp)

20. Click on the "Install now" button to continue.

![](../../img/1/4.img-20.webp)

21. Enter your personal software product key, then click on the "Next" button.

![](../../img/1/4.img-21.webp)

22. Accept the license agreement

- Click on the "Next" button to continue

![](../../img/1/4.img-22.webp)

23. Select the appropriate installation type

- You have no existing operating system to "Upgrade" ...so select the "Custom" installation type instead

![](../../img/1/4.img-23.webp)

24. This screen identifies the options available for installing the operating system onto a hard disk

- Your virtual machine configuration profile includes only (1) virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) file
- As such, only (1) hard disk is listed above
- Click on the "Next" button to continue

![](../../img/1/4.img-24.webp)

25. DO NOT sign in using personal username and password credentials

- Click on the option "Domain join instead"
- This option will keep the Guest OS in a state

![](../../img/1/4.img-25.webp)

26. Create a generic local user account on the new host

- Keep the username simple (e.g. localuser), and set its password to (P&ssw0rd)
- This local user account will have full administrative authority on the Guest OS

![](../../img/1/4.img-26.webp)

27. Enter a password of (P&ssw0rd) for the new (localuser) account

![](../../img/1/4.img-27.webp)

28. Confirm the password

- Enter a password of (P&ssw0rd) for the new (localuser) account

![](../../img/1/4.img-28.webp)

29. Complete the security questions using information which you will easily remember if you ever forget this user account's password value

![](../../img/1/4.img-29.webp)

## Customizing the Guest OS

30. Most Microsoft Windows hosts are configured initially with Pacific Standard Time (PST) time zone.

- This means that the host's internal clock will be off by (3) hours, and will affect folder and file timestamps, log file event entries, etc.
- To correct this, it must be configured for an Eastern Standard Time (EST) time zone.
- Click on the "Date and Time" Control Panel applet.

![](../../img/1/4.img-30.webp)

31. Click on the "Change time zone..." button (A), then select Eastern Time from the drop-down selection list (B).

- Click on each of the "OK" buttons to save the setting change.

![](../../img/1/4.img-31.webp)

32. When testing network connectivity, the most annoying feature of any operating system is the internal firewall.

- The firewall feature blocks certain communications by default (which at this point, we do not want).
- Click on the "Windows Defender Firewall" Control Panel applet.

![](../../img/1/4.img-32.webp)

33. Click on the "Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off" option.

![](../../img/1/4.img-33.webp)

34. Disable the firewall feature for both the Private and Public network interfaces of the Guest OS.

- Click on the "OK" button when finished.

![](../../img/1/4.img-34.webp)

35. Click on the "All Control Panel Items" option in the navigation field to return to the main Control Panel app selection screen.

![](../../img/1/4.img-35.webp)

36. Click on the "Power Options" Control Panel applet.

![](../../img/1/4.img-36.webp)

37. Click on the option to "Choose when to turn off the display."

- By default, the display of a Microsoft Windows host will turn off after a short period of time.
- It will turn the Guest OS' screen black.
- So you don't have to hit a key on the keyboard, shake the mouse, etc., after every few minutes of inactivity, it is best to configure the screen to never turn off.

![](../../img/1/4.img-37.webp)

38. From the drop-down list(s), select the "Never" option(s).

![](../../img/1/4.img-38.webp)

39. Click on the "Save changes" button to activate and save this setting change.

![](../../img/1/4.img-39.webp)

40. Click on the "All Control Panel Items" option in the navigation field to return to the main Control Panel app selection screen.

![](../../img/1/4.img-40.webp)

41. When the Microsoft Windows operating system was initially installed, the unique hostname associated with the Guest OS was randomly created.

- A random value makes it difficult to remember and is meaningless.
- You will change this value to include your personal 9-digit number.
- Click on the "System" Control Panel applet.

![](../../img/1/4.img-41.webp)

42. Identify the (current) randomized hostname value for the Guest OS.

- Click on the "Change settings" option.

![](../../img/1/4.img-42.webp)

43. Click on the "Change" button and type in a new hostname value using the format (w000123456a).

- Replace the fictitious 9-digit value with your personal 9-digit number.
- This will ensure all hosts on the network, at any given time, are unique and will not be in direct conflict with any other host.

![](../../img/1/4.img-43.webp)

44. Once the hostname value has been changed, click on the "OK" button to save the setting change.

- As indicated, the Guest OS will need to be restarted in order for the new hostname value to become active.

![](../../img/1/4.img-44.webp)

45. Click on the "Close" button.

![](../../img/1/4.img-45.webp)

46. Restart the Guest OS when prompted.

![](../../img/1/4.img-46.webp)

47. At the "Sign-on Screen", authenticate with the Localuser's security credentials (Username = localuser) and (Password = P&ssw0rd).

- Hit the `<Enter>` key on the keyboard, or click on the arrow icon, to complete the authentication process.

![](../../img/1/4.img-47.webp)

## Updating the Operating System

48. Click on the "Check for updates" button to see if there are even more software updates available for this host.

- If there are, go through the update process again like before.
- Repeat this process over and over again until a message appears near the top of this window, indicating that the host is completely up to date (see next step).

![](../../img/1/4.img-48.webp)

49. Manually restart the Guest OS to make sure all the software updates have been completely installed.

- From the "Start Menu", select the option to restart the host.

![](../../img/1/4.img-49.webp)

## Installing the Guest Additions

- From the menu bar, located at the top of the Guest OS console window, select the following menu options:
  - Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD Image

50. Click on "This PC”.

- Your file system context will be changed to show all file systems this Guest OS currently has access to.
- Next, double-click on the "VirtualBox Guest Additions" CD, which is associated with the virtual CD/DVD-ROM drive.

![](../../img/1/4.img-50.webp)

51. If the auto-run feature does not automatically launch, you may need to double-click on the explicit executable to begin the installation of the Oracle VM VirtualBox Guest Additions.

![](../../img/1/4.img-51.webp)

52. Install the Oracle VM VirtualBox Guest Additions software product using the default settings.

- Click on the "Next" button to continue.

![](../../img/1/4.img-52.webp)

53. Ensure the checkbox is enabled to always trust software officially developed and distributed by Oracle Corporation.

- Click on the "Install" button to continue.

![](../../img/1/4.img-53.webp)

54. Click on the "Finish" button to restart the Guest OS.

![](../../img/1/4.img-54.webp)

55. Resize the Guest OS console window.

- The Guest OS' desktop will resize accordingly if the Guest Additions were installed successfully.

![](../../img/1/4.img-55.webp)

## Notepad++ Text Editor

- The default text editor application which comes with a Microsoft Windows operating system is called Notepad.
- Notepad is a very basic text editor and does not include features a Network Administrator or Software Developer desperately needs (editing multiple documents concurrently, block editing, line numbering, exposing whitespace characters, etc.).
- As such, it is wise for you to seek out a text editing application which is more powerful.
- Some will cost you money, while others may be free.
- The text editor that has been standardized on is Notepad++ and is free to use.
- Notepad++ is a rich-featured text editor.

## Activating the Operating System

- Most software products you will work with require activation using a legally acquired license, user account credentials, or a product activation key.
- Without proper activation, many software products from Microsoft Corporation will disable critical features after a period of time has lapsed, crippling the functionality of the software product and making it basically useless.
- The product activation process is identical for both the Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Windows Server operating systems.
- If you experience difficulties activating your operating system product, skip to the last section in this PowerPoint slide-set entitled (Phoned-Based Product Activation).
- This alternative process for activating the operating system product works if:
  - ...you receive error messages during the normal activation process.
  - ...you are attempting to activate the operating system product without Internet connectivity.
  - ...you are trying to activate the operating system using the same product activation key more than once.

56. From the "Activation" window, note that this operating system is currently activated.

- If your operating system is not activated, click on the "Change product key" option.
- When prompted, enter your personal product activation code and activate your operating system.
- If you receive an error message or are unable to activate your operating system, skip to the last section in this PowerPoint slide-set and go through the Phone-based Product Activation process.

![](../../img/1/4.img-56.webp)

## Backing up the (`*.vdi`) File

- Final Operating System Update
  - The Guest OS installation, customization, and activation is now complete.
  - You should check one last time to ensure the Guest OS' operating system is completely up to date.
  - Complete that process now before continuing.
- You have just spent a few hours creating a Guest OS.
- The last thing you want is to lose all of the work you just put into creating the Guest OS.
- The entire Guest OS is contained within a single file located on your Host OS, called a virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) file.
- Making a copy of the (`*.vdi`) file ensures you have something to revert back to in the event of a catastrophe with your original (`*.vdi`) file.
- The next section will guide you through the process of disassociating virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) files and CD/DVD ISO image (`*.iso`) files with an Oracle VM VirtualBox virtual machine profile, and then backing up the (`*.vdi`) file.

57. Gracefully shut down the Guest OS.

- From the "Start Menu", select the option to "shut down" the host.
- Let the Guest OS complete its graceful shut down before continuing.
- This Guest OS console window will completely disappear once the process has finished.

![](../../img/1/4.img-57.webp)

## The Virtual Media Manager Repository

- From the Oracle VM VirtualBox application menu bar, select the following menu options:
  - File -> Virtual Media Manager,
- The Virtual Media Manager is an interface to the repository of all virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) files and CD/DVD image (`*.iso`) files.
- From within the Virtual Media Manager, you can release, remove, and modify each image file.
- Release: Disassociates the image file with any virtual machine configuration profile.
  - The image file remains in the Virtual Media Manager.
- Remove: Removes the image file from the Virtual Media Manager.
  - Must be released prior to a remove attempt.
  - Be careful to NOT delete the image file.
- Properties: Changes the mode of an image file and how it behaves (Normal = read+write), (Immutable = write protected), etc.
  - Must be released first.

58. For the virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) file, note that it cannot be removed at this point.

- It must first be released from the associated virtual machine configuration profile.

![](../../img/1/4.img-58.webp)

59. Also make note of the location of the (`*.vdi`) file (it should be located on your portable USB-powered storage device).

![](../../img/1/4.img-59.webp)

60. Click on the (Release) icon, and release the virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) file from the (Microsoft Windows) virtual machine configuration profile.

![](../../img/1/4.img-60.webp)

61. Once the image file has been released from a virtual machine configuration profile, you are then able to remove it from the Virtual Media Manager repository.

![](../../img/1/4.img-61.webp)

62. Click on the (Remove) icon, and remove the virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) file from the Virtual Media Manager repository.

- WARNING, DO NOT delete the file when prompted (see next step).

![](../../img/1/4.img-62.webp)

63. There are very few times where you will delete the image file from within the Oracle VM VirtualBox application environment.

- Select the option to (Keep) the image file.

![](../../img/1/4.img-63.webp)

64. The Virtual Media Manager now includes zero virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) files (a.k.a. hard disk image files).

![](../../img/1/4.img-64.webp)

65. There are (2) CD/DVD installation media currently in the Virtual Media Manager.

- Using similar steps as before (with the virtual hard disk (`*.vdi`) image) ...remove these (2) CD/DVD installation media from the Virtual Media Manager.

![](../../img/1/4.img-65.webp)

66. Now, the Virtual Media Manager repository includes zero CD/DVD image files and zero hard disk image files.

- Close the Virtual Media Manager interface.

![](../../img/1/4.img-66.webp)

67. With no attached virtual hard disk (`*.vdi`) file to the (Microsoft Windows) virtual machine configuration profile, you can now complete the removal process.

- Right-click on the (Microsoft Windows) virtual machine configuration profile and select "Remove..." from the shortcut menu options.

![](../../img/1/4.img-67.webp)

68. Select the option to delete all remaining files associated with the (Microsoft Windows) virtual machine profile, then close the Oracle VM VirtualBox application.

![](../../img/1/4.img-68.webp)

69. On the Host OS, make a copy of the virtual disk image (`*.vdi`) file that includes your Microsoft Windows 10 Guest OS installation.

- In the image above, (A) is the original file, and (B) is a backup copy of (A) ...where each file is located below a meaningful folder name.

![](../../img/1/4.img-69.webp)
