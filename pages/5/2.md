# Creating User Accounts

- By default, only the (`root`) administrative user account has the permissions to manage user accounts.
- Similar to Microsoft SAM databases and Microsoft Active Directory, username values should be unique.
- For a UNIX or UNIX "like" environment, user account (username values) may not include characters which are not alphanumerical, with the exception of the period (`.`) character.
- Invalid username values on a UNIX or UNIX "like" node would include (`john#smith`), (`john  smith`), and (`john+smith`), as they contain invalid characters in their value.
- Historically, UNIX and UNIX "like" username values were based on the person's surname and the first character of their given name.
- For example, the user (`John Smith`) would typically have had a username value of (`smithj`).
- If there was another user called (`Joan Smith`), who needed to sign on to the same UNIX or UNIX "like" node, then typically they would have had a username value of (`smithj2`) assuming their user account was created after (`John Smith's`).
- Today, UNIX and UNIX "like" username values can now contain the period (`.`) character; we can now create usernames like (`john.smith`) or (`anna.taylor`).
