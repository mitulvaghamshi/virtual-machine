# Local Name Resolution

- To resolve hostname and FQDN values without the use of DNS services, the (`root`) administrative user account will need to modify the (`/etc/hosts`) text-based file with a text editing application.
- The most common text editing application (a.k.a. text editor) found on all UNIX and UNIX "like" nodes is called (`vim`).
- Although there are many text editors available for UNIX and UNIX "like" nodes (most of which are less cryptic to use), there is no guarantee that those text editors will be installed on each node you work with. (`vim`) is available on all UNIX and UNIX "like" nodes, so it is advised that you become familiar with its basic operations.

1. Edit the existing (`/etc/hosts`) file.

- Be careful, as a UNIX or UNIX "like" environment is case-sensitive.

```console
[root@ol000123456a ~]# vim /etc/hosts
```

2. Using the arrow keys on the keyboard, go to the last possible cursor position in the file.

```console
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4. localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6. localdomain6
```

3. Press the letter (`i`) on the keyboard.

- This will switch you into "Insert Mode" for the (`vim`) text editor.
- Move your cursor over to the right one more position, and then press the `<Enter>` key a few times.
- This will create a few blank lines so you can add some new text to this file.

```console
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4. localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
~
~
-- INSERT --
```

4. While in "Insert Mode”, add the resolution details for the nodes on the network.

- The information for each line includes the IPv4 address followed by the associated hostname value.
- This is what the (`ping`) utility will use later on to resolve each hostname to its associated IPv4 address.

```console
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6

10.1.1.10   01000123456a
10.1.1.20   01000123456b
~
~
-- INSERT --
```

5. To save the changes to the file, you will need to get out of "Insert Mode” and back into "Command Mode”.

- To do so, hit the `<ESC>` key on the keyboard.
- To save the changes to the file, type the keyboard sequence (`:wq!`), and then press the `<Enter>` key.
- Changes to the file have now been saved.
- To abort the changes to the file, type the keyboard sequence (`:q!`), and press the `<Enter>` key.
- Changes to the file have now been aborted.

```console
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6

10.1.1.10   01000123456a
10.1.1.20   01000123456b
~
~
:wq!
```

6. Use the (`ping`) utility to verify hostname values are being resolved locally to their correct IPv4 addresses.

```console
[root@ol000123456a ~]# ping ol000123456a
