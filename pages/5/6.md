## Tasks

1. Start both the (Oracle Linux - 1) and (Oracle Linux - 2) virtual machines.

- Sign on to each of the Guest OSes using the root account's security credentials.

2. On the (Oracle Linux - 1) Guest OS, change the IP address settings from a dynamic configuration to a static configuration.

- Use the IP address of (`10.1.1.10`) and a subnet mask of (`255.255.255.0`).
- Set the default gateway address to (`10.1.1.1`) even though it does not exist.

3. On the (Oracle Linux - 2) Guest OS, change the hostname value from the format (`ol000123456a`) to (`ol000123456b`).

4. On the (Oracle Linux - 2) Guest OS, change the IP address settings from a dynamic configuration to a static configuration.

- Use the IP address of (`10.1.1.20`) and a subnet mask of (`255.255.255.0`).
- Set the default gateway address to (`10.1.1.1`) even though it does not exist.

5. Verify network connectivity between the (2) Guest OSes.

- On both Guest OSes, modify the existing (`/etc/hosts`) file such that you are able to resolve the hostname for each of the (2) nodes in your network.

6. From the (Oracle Linux - 1) Guest OS, you should be able to resolve and ping (for example) both:

- `ol000123456a`
- `ol000123456b`

7. From the (Oracle Linux - 2) Guest OS, you should be able to resolve and ping (for example) both:

- `ol000123456a`
- `ol000123456b`

8. On the (Oracle Linux - 1) Guest OS, create a new user account for the following individual, and sign on with the new user account afterwards.

- Full Name: `John Smith`
- Username: `john.smith`
- Password: `A&p4YM6@`

9. On the (Oracle Linux - 2) Guest OS, create a new user account for the following individual, and sign on with the new user account afterwards.

- Full Name: `Anna Taylor`
- Username: `anna.taylor`
- Password: `A&p4YM6@`

10. As user (`John Smith`), create the following directory structure and files, below the user's home directory.

- Ensure you use only commands to complete this task (directories; files).

```console
├── MyData/
│   ├── Spreadsheets/
│   │   ├── Current Budget.xlsx
│   ├── Documents/
│   │   ├── Resume - Smith.docx
│   ├── Image Files/
│   │   ├── Image-01.webp
│   │   ├── Image-02.webp
│   ├── Text Files/
│   │   ├── Meeting Notes/
│   │   │   ├── Minutes from Meeting - Jan 24.txt
```

11. As user (`Anna Taylor`), create the following directory structure and files, below the user's home directory.

- Ensure you use only commands to complete this task (directories; files).

```console
├── MyData/
│   ├── Spreadsheets/
│   │   ├── Current Budget.xlsx
│   ├── Documents/
│   │   ├── Resume - Smith.docx
│   ├── Image Files/
│   │   ├── Image-01.webp
│   │   ├── Image-02.webp
│   ├── Text Files/
│   │   ├── Meeting Notes/
│   │   │   ├── Minutes from Meeting - Jan 24.txt
```

12. As user (`John Smith`), remove all files and directories you created earlier below the user's home directory.

13. As user (`Anna Taylor`), move the existing (`Image-02.webp`) file into the (Meeting Notes) directory.

14. As user (`root`), on either of the Guest OSes, identify the absolute reference for the file called (`oracle-linux-ol8.repo`).

- The file is located somewhere on the node's filesystem.
- Locate it, and document the absolute reference for the file.
- Also document the single command you used to find this file.

15. As user (`root`), on either of the Guest OSes, identify whether (`/etc/skel/.bash_profile`) is a regular file or a directory.

16. As user (`root`), on either of the Guest OSes, copy (1) file from your Host OS into the Guest OS and below the (root) user's home directory.
