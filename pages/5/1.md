# Oracle Linux

## UNIX: Background

- UNIX is an operating system that has been around since the 1960s.
- UNIX is a trademarked name (www.unix.org).
- A UNIX operating system is one that conforms to a set of standards and is registered with the governing body of the trademark.
- All other similar operating systems cannot be called UNIX operating systems.
- Therefore, when we talk about Linux "variants" (e.g. Red Hat Enterprise
- Linux, Oracle Linux, CentOS Linux, Ubuntu Linux, etc.), Oracle
- OpenSolaris, BSD "variants" (FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD), etc., we simply refer to them all as UNIX "like" operating systems.
- UNIX "like" operating systems are very similar to a real UNIX operating system, but either do not comply 100% with the set of standards or were not registered with the governing body of the trademark.

## Linux: Background

- Linux is an operating system that has been around since the 1990s.
- Linux is a trademarked name (www.linuxmark.org).
- Linux refers to the kernel, and not the operating system as a whole.
- Therefore, any operating system that utilizes the Linux kernel is generally referred to as a Linux "based" operating system.
- The Linux kernel by itself is basically useless to most people. As such,
- Linux "distributions" are created which provide additional supporting software (along with the Linux kernel) to make a more complete and functional operating system.
- There are many Linux distributions to choose from, with each having its own strengths and weaknesses.
- Google Android is a Linux "based" operating system and is found on the majority of smartphones worldwide.

## UNIX: Today

- Since the 1960s, many variations of the UNIX operating system have come and gone.
- The most notable (currently active) UNIX operating system platforms include:
  - Hewlett Packard (HP-UX)
  - IBM AIX
  - IBM z/OS
  - Oracle Solaris
  - Apple macOS (and older: Apple OSX, Apple Mac OSX)

## Linux: Today

- Since the 1990s, many Linux operating system distributions have come and gone.
- The more notable (currently active) Linux operating system platforms include:
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  - Oracle Linux
  - CentOS Linux
  - Ubuntu Linux
  - Debian Linux
  - (Red Hat) Fedora

## Major UNIX Operating System Components

- Regardless of the UNIX "flavour" you are using (e.g Linux, BSD, Solaris, macOS, etc.), they all have very similar functionality (4) of the major components in all UNIX and UNIX "like" operating systems versions are the:
  - Kernel
  - Shell
  - Filesystem
  - Utilities
  - UNIX Kernel
- The kernel is the core (e.g. nucleus) of any UNIX or UNIX "like" operating system.
- The kernel provides basic services for the rest of the operating system by supporting functionality such as:
  - Multi-tasking
  - File reads and writes
  - Connectivity to networks and devices
  - Resource allocation
- Often, the only major difference between (2) UNIX or UNIX "like" nodes is which kernel version they run.

## UNIX Shell

- The shell is the part of the UNIX or UNIX "like" operating system that:
  - Provides a command-line interface where the user can execute commands.
  - Interprets the user commands.
  - Passes the interpreted commands to the kernel.
- The Microsoft Windows equivalent to the UNIX or UNIX "like" shell would be the Microsoft Windows Command Interpreter (cmd.exe) or Microsoft
  - Windows Powershell (powershell.exe).

## UNIX Shell Options

- There are several popular UNIX and UNIX "like" shells available:
  - Bourne Shell (sh).
  - Bourne-Again Shell (bash).
  - C Shell (csh).
  - Korn Shell (ksh).
- Each shell has its own strengths and weaknesses.
- Users, in most situations, will use the Bourne-Again Shell (bash).

## UNIX Filesystems

- To UNIX and UNIX "like" nodes, EVERYTHING is a file.
- Applications, data, printers, hard disks, optical discs, even a mouse, are represented as files.
- UNIX Supported Filesystem Types
- Some of the filesystem types that UNIX and UNIX "like" operating systems support include:
  - xfs: Default filesystem for many newer Linux distributions.
  - ext4: 4th extended filesystem (still used with many Linux distributions).
  - exFAT: Provides support for Microsoft's exFAT (read + write).
  - NTFS: Provides support for Microsoft's NTFS (read-only).

## UNIX Utilities

- Utilities are software tools included as a standard part of a UNIX or UNIX "like" operating system.
- Commands are constructed using utilities as the starting point.
- Here is a utility: `ls`.
- Here is a command: `ls -l MyResume.docx`.

## UNIX Desktop Options

- There are (2) main UNIX interfaces:
  - Command-line Shell Prompt (text-based; CLI)
  - Graphical Desktop (GUI)
- Most regular users will interface with a UNIX or UNIX "like" node using the
- Graphical Desktop environment, similar to a Microsoft Windows node.
- Most administrators and power users will interface with a UNIX or UNIX "like" node using the Command-line Shell Prompt.
- The command-line provides more functionality and supports script execution.

## Filesystem Directories

- In UNIX, all directories and files are stored in one common hierarchical tree structure with the root directory (designated as: `/`) at the top of the structure.
- There is no concept of volume letters (e.g. `C:`, `F:`, `K:`, etc.) as is commonly used in a Microsoft Windows operating system.
- Files are organized into directories which function like the folders you create using Microsoft File Explorer.
- The term "folder" is used when referencing a directory using a GUI interface.
- The term "directory" is used when referencing a directory using a CLI interface.
- UNIX directories are actually files that store information about the files (and other directories) they contain.

## Home Directory

- When a user signs on to a UNIX or UNIX "like" node, they are placed in their user account's home directory.
- This is a special directory that the node creates when a user account is created.
- Typically, each user has his/her own home directory where the user stores personal files.
- This keeps a user's files separate from the files of other users who may sign on to the same node.
- A user's home directory is designated as (`~`).

## Filesystem Navigation

- At a Graphical Desktop level, a UNIX or UNIX "like" node's filesystem is relatively easy to navigate.
- It is extremely similar to a Microsoft Windows node, as seen through the Microsoft File Explorer interface.
- On a UNIX or UNIX "like" node, most administrators navigate the filesystem using the Command-line (Shell Prompt) Interface.

## Things to remember

- All directories are located somewhere below the root of the node's filesystem (`/`), even if they are located on a different physical disk or shared folder (from another node on the network).
- All directories are separated by the use of a forward-slash character (`/`).
- All file and directory names are case-sensitive.
- References to files and directories can be either absolute or relative (to your current directory context).

## Absolute and Relative References

- An example of an absolute reference to a file is: `/Data/Budgets/January.xlsx`.
- When you use the leading forward-slash, you are making an absolute reference to the file (or directory) residing on the node's filesystem.
- An example of a relative reference to a file is: `../MyResume.docx` or `../../../TasksToComplete.txt`.
- Each double dot (`..`) references one directory backwards through the node's filesystem, towards the root (`/`) of the filesystem.
- There are (2) methods to indicate a file or directory that is located in your current directory context: `MyResume.docx` or `./MyResume.docx`
- The first method is implicit.
  - The UNIX or UNIX "like" node assumes that you mean the file in your current directory context, because you did not explicitly state it.
- The second method is explicit.
  - There is no confusion as to which file is being referenced.
  - It IS located in your current directory context.

## Files and Directories with Spaces

- It is quite common for all users to create files and directories (and folders) using the `<space>` character.
- Similar to a Microsoft Windows host, the `<spaces>` must be preserved using quotation marks, when working at a command-line level.
- An example of an absolute reference to a file and directory containing `<spaces>` is: `"/Sales Department/Budgets/January 24.xlsx"`
- An example of a relative reference to a file containing `<spaces>` is: `"../../Resume - John Smith.docx"`

## File and Directory Details

- When inspecting file or directory details at a command-line level, a lot of information will be provided.
- For example:

```console
ï£¿ ~ % ls -la
total 160
drwxr-x---+  41 john.smith  staff   1312 Feb  7 23:51 .
drwxr-xr-x    5 root        admin    160 Feb  6 01:51 ..
drwx------@  23 john.smith  staff    736 Feb 10 21:55 .Trash
drwx------@   4 john.smith  staff    128 Jan 1 20:41 Desktop
drwxr-xr-x    6 john.smith  staff    192 Jan 25 10:25 Developer

```

- File and Directory Details

```console
-rw-r-xr-w. 1 john.smith john.smith 4096 Jan 24 15:24 MyResume.docx
drwxrwxr-w. 4 john.smith john.smith   37 Feb 15 21:06 My Data
```

- `-`: Indicates the file is a regular file
- `d`: Indicates the file is a directory

```

## Utility: cd

- The (`cd`) utility is used to change your current directory context

```console
# Change my directory context to my home directory
$ cd

$ cd Downloads

# Change my directory context to the (Downloads) directory, which is located immediately below my current directory context
$ cd ./Downloads

# Change my directory context to the (skel) directory, which is located below the (etc) directory, off the root of the node's filesystem.
$ cd /etc/skel

# Change my directory context to the (Videos) directory, which is located (1) directory above my current directory context.
$ cd ../Videos

# Change my directory context to the (Videos) directory, which is located (3) directories above my current directory context.

$ cd "../../../My Data Files"

# Change my directory context to the directory that is located (3) directories above my current directory context.
$ cd ../../..
```

## Utility: pwd

- The (`pwd`) utility is used to identify your current directory context on the filesystem (which directory you are currently in).

```console
$ pwd
```

## Utility: ls

- The (`ls`) utility is used to perform a directory listing.

```console
# List all the non-hidden files and directories located at my current directory context.

# Provide detailed information about each file and directory.
$ ls -l

# List all files and directories (including the hidden ones) located at my current directory context.
$ ls -a

# List all files and directories (including the hidden ones) located at my current directory context.
# Provide detailed information about each file and directory.

$ touch File-01.txt (or) $ touch ./File-01.txt

# Create a new empty file at my current directory context.
$ touch "My New File.xlsx"

# Create a new empty file, (2) directories above my current directory context.
$ touch "../../My Resume.docx"
```

## Utility: mkdir

- The (`mkdir`) utility is used to create a new empty directory.

```console
# Create a new directory at my current directory context
$ mkdir MyData

# Create a new directory at my current directory context
$ mkdir "My Data Files"

# Create a new directory, below the existing directory called (My Data - Files), which is located immediately below my home directory
$ mkdir "~/My Data Files/Budgets"

# Create a new directory, (3) directories above my current directory context, and below the existing directory called (My Data Files)
$ mkdir "../../../My Data Files/Budgets"
```

## Utility: cp

- The (`cp`) utility is used to copy a file or directory structure to a new location on the filesystem

```console
# Make a copy of a file
# The existing file (File-01.txt) is located at my current directory context
# The new file (File-02.txt) will be created at my current directory context
$ cp File-01.txt File-02.txt

# Make a copy of a file
# The existing file (File-01.txt) is located at my current directory context
# The new file (File-02.txt) will be created (2) directories above my current directory context
$ cp ./File-01.txt ../../File-02.txt

# Make a copy of a file
# The existing file (File-01.txt) is located at my current directory context
# The new copied file (File-01.txt) will be created (2) directories above my current directory context, and below the existing directory called (My Data Files).
# If the directory (My Data Files) does not exist, then the new file will be called (My Data Files) instead of (File-01.txt).
$ cp File-01.txt "../../My Data Files"

# Make a copy of an entire directory structure (My Data) into the (My Backups) folder, which is located (1) directory above my current directory context.
# -R: Recursive (all files and directories below the source directory).
$ cp -R "My Data" "../My Backups"
```

## Utility: mv

- The (`mv`) utility is used to move an existing file or directory structure from one location to another.
- The (`mv`) utility is also used to rename an existing file or directory from one name to another.

```console
# Rename the existing file (File-01.txt) at my current directory context to (File-02.txt).
$ mv ./File-01.txt ./File-02.txt

# Move the existing file (File-01.txt) at my current directory context to a directory called (My Data Files), which is located (2) directories above my current directory context.
# If the directory (My Data Files) does not exist, then the file will be moved and renamed to (My Data Files).
$ mv ./File-01.txt "../../My Data Files"
```

## Utility: rm

- The (`rm`) utility is used to delete an existing file.

```console
# Delete a file at my current directory context.
$ rm "./Budget Presentation.pptx"

# Delete a file in the (Budgets) directory, which is located (3) directories above my current directory context.
$ rm "../../../Budgets/Budget Presentation.pptx"
```

## Utility: rmdir

- The (`rmdir`) utility is used to delete an existing empty directory.

```console
# Delete a directory at my current directory context.
$ rmdir Budgets

# Delete a directory called (Copies of Resumes), which is located (2) directories above my current directory context.
$ rmdir "../../Copies of Resumes"
```

## Utility: find

- The (`find`) utility is used to locate files and directories somewhere on the filesystem.
- With the thousands of files and directories on a UNIX or UNIX "like" node, the (`find`) utility is one of the most important utilities you could master.

```console
# Locate all files ending with (.conf) on the entire node (all filesystems).
# Display any access error messages.
# -iname: Any case for the file or directory name (case insensitive).
$ find / -type f -iname "`*.conf`"

# Locate all files called (MyFile.txt) on the entire node (all filesystems).
# Do not display any access error messages.
# -type f: Locates only files.
# 2> /dev/null: Do not display any access error messages.
$ find / -type f -iname "MyFile.txt" 2> /dev/null

# Locate all directories with the string (budget) somewhere in the name.
# Searches the entire node (all filesystems).
# -type d: Locates only directories.
$ find / -type d -iname "*budget*" 2> /dev/null

# Locate all files ending in (.docx) which exist somewhere below my home directory.
$ find ~ -type f -iname "`*.docx`"

# Locate all files ending in (.xlsx) which exist somewhere below the (/Data/Sales Department) directory.
$ find "/Data/Sales Department" -type f -iname "`*.xlsx`"
```
