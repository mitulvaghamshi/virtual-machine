# Oracle Linux Network Settings

- Similar to a Microsoft Windows node, an Oracle Linux node will need to have its hostname and IP address settings configured.
- This ensures the node will be uniquely identified on the network.
- By default, only the (`root`) administrative user account has the permissions to change system-wide configuration details like the hostname and IP addressing settings.

1. Sign on to the node using the (`root`) administrative user account security credentials.

2. Username is (`root`), and typed in lowercase.

3. Password is (`Adm1np&ss`), and is case-sensitive.

4. Verify the existing hostname and IP address settings.

- Launch the (Terminal) application to get to a shell prompt.

5. The (`hostname`) command will reveal the current hostname value for this node.

- The (`ifconfig`) command will reveal the current IP address settings for this node.
- Note that there are no IPv4 address details for this node's network adapter.

```console
[root@ol000123456a ~]# hostname

6. Launch the (Settings) applet to change both the hostname and IP address settings for this node.

7. The hostname value is changed using the (Details) settings applet option.

![](../../img/5/4.img-7.webp)

8. The current hostname value is displayed.

![](../../img/5/4.img-8.webp)

9. Change the hostname value to a unique value on your network and close the applet.

- Changes will be immediate.

![](../../img/5/4.img-9.webp)

10. Verify the hostname value has changed for the node.

```console
[root@ol000123456b ~]# hostname
01000123456b
[root@ol000123456b ~]#
```

11. IP address settings are changed using the (Network) settings applet option.

![](../../img/5/4.img-11.webp)

12. Click on the gear icon associated with the wired network adapter to change the network adapter settings.

![](../../img/5/4.img-12.webp)

13. From the IPv4 settings category, use the radio button selection icon to change from a dynamic (automatic) IP configuration to a static (manual) IP configuration.

![](../../img/5/4.img-13.webp)

14. A (manual) IP configuration will then allow you to enter in static IP address and corresponding subnet mask values.

- On some Linux distributions, a gateway address is mandatory, even though there might not be a router located on the network.

15. Type in the IP address setting values and click on the (Apply) button to save the configuration changes.

![](../../img/5/4.img-15.webp)

16. Verify the IP address settings have been updated for the network adapter.

- Here we see there is now IPv4 address information, where before, this network adapter did not have any.

```

17. Verify network connectivity to a remote node on the network.

- On a Linux host, the (`ping`) utility will test forever.
- To get back to the shell prompt, press the (CTRL+C) key combination.
- This key combination will stop the (`ping`) testing and return you to the shell prompt.

```console
[root@ol000123456b ~]# ping 10.1.1.10
