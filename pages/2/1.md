# IP Networking

## Computer Networks

- In the world of computing, a network is a collection of both hardware and software components (working together) that are able to communicate with one another.
- The term node is used to generically identify a network-connected device.
  - A web server is a node.
  - An e-mail server is a node.
  - A database server is a node.
  - A personal desktop computer system is a node.
  - A network-connected printer is a node.
  - Notebook computer systems, smartphones, and tablets are nodes.
- Nodes can be physically connected to a network (using a cable) or wirelessly connected (without a cable).

## Unique Identification

- Each node that is connected to a network must be uniquely identified in some way, or how would you be able to distinguish between them?
- A unique **Media Access Control (MAC)** address is hard-coded into each network adapter.
- A MAC address is also known as a physical address.
- Each MAC address is a 12-digit hexadecimal value and is typically documented using a delimiting character.
- Examples:
  - `00-24-d6-a7-b4-3f` (most common notation)
  - `00:24:d6:a7:b4:3f`
- A single node may include one or more network adapters and, therefore, will have one or more MAC addresses associated with it.

## Node Connectivity

- Nodes on a network are connected together by way of one or more types of network devices: **Switches**, **Wireless Access Points**, and **Routers**.
- A network switch is a device which nodes physically plug into using a cable.
- Network switches can be wired together to create a larger network.
- Wireless access points are used to connect wireless-capable nodes, including smartphones and tablets.
- Routers are used to connect together multiple networks.
- A combination of multiple switches, wireless access points, and routers is connected together to create the networks we see at home and in work environments.
- The Internet is just a collection of all networks around the world which are joined together.
- For home networks, the physical box that connects all your nodes to the Internet (e.g. Linksys, Cisco, Apple, etc.) most likely includes all (3) network device components.
  - It is a wireless access point for you to connect your wireless nodes.
  - It has a few ports on it to physically connect your wired nodes, and therefore is a network switch.
  - It forwards data communications in and out to the Internet, and therefore is a router.

## The Internet Protocol (IP)

- A communication protocol is a set of rules which govern how nodes talk to one another on a network.
- Think of a communication protocol like a spoken language.
- Put two people in a room.
- One person speaks only English, and the second person speaks only French.
- Not a lot of communication from one person will be understood by the other person.
- The same can be applied to nodes on a network.
- All nodes must be capable of communicating using the same communication protocol, or no discernible information will be conveyed.
- The Internet Protocol (IP) is the most widely used communication protocol.
- Most nodes globally use the Internet Protocol to communicate in some way or another.
- IP is a routable protocol, providing a method of communicating between nodes located on a very small network, or nodes located on very large networks (including the Internet).
- Router devices determine the pathway (a.k.a. the route) IP protocol communications take when nodes need to communicate with one another.
- IP provides logical address values that are then associated to MAC address values (creating a logical-to-physical relationship).
- Communicating between multiple routed networks, using only MAC addresses, is not possible.
- MAC address awareness remains at a localized network level.
- MAC address lists are not propagated to other networks, (typically) beyond a router device.
- Each node maintains a list of recently communicated local nodes in an ARP table (**ARP: Address Resolution Protocol**).
- Nodes use the information in their ARP table to communicate with other nodes on the same localized network.

## IP, MAC, and Port Numbers

- IP addresses are used to locate a node's network.
- Both IP addresses and MAC addresses, together, are used to locate a specific node on the network.
- Port numbers are used to identify which application or service is to be used to process the received data.
- All (3) items (IP address, MAC address, and port number) are required in order for one node to successfully communicate with another node on a network.

## The Internet Protocol (IP)

- Currently, there are (2) implemented versions of the **Internet Protocol** (IP):
  - **IPv4**: Internet Protocol (version 4)
  - **IPv6**: Internet Protocol (version 6)

## IPv4 Addresses

- IPv4 addresses are (4) decimal delimited decimal values.
- Examples:
  - `142.222.45.73`
  - `192.168.100.20`
  - `10.1.2.10`
  - `206.191.86.29`
  - `127.0.0.1`
  - `169.254.15.94`
- Range: `0.0.0.0` through `255.255.255.255`
- Limitation: Only (4.3 billion) unique logical addresses exist for IPv4.
- The Internet has run out of IPv4 addresses.

## IPv6 Addresses

- IPv6 addresses are (8) colon delimited hexadecimal values.
- Examples:
- `2001:0da0:0023:0000:0000:d40e:0000:0064`
- `2001:da0:23:0:0:d40e:0:64` (shortened)
- `2001:da0:23::d40e:0:64` (shortened again)
- `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1`
- `::1` (shortened)
- Globally, most networks currently utilize IPv4 as opposed to IPv6.
- Home networks, business networks, and the Internet are in a transition phase from IPv4 to IPv6.
- This is a very slow process (years), as:
  - Most network administrators are reluctant to switch over to IPv6.
  - Many hardware products have not been updated to work with IPv6.
  - Many software products have not been updated to work with IPv6.
- If IPv6 were to completely replace IPv4, then the Internet would virtually never run out of IP addresses ever again.

## Multiple IP Addresses

- Each node's network adapter can potentially have multiple IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses associated with it.

## IPv4 Addressing

- An IPv4 address contains (2) pieces of information:
  - Network ID
  - Node ID (a.k.a. Host ID)
- The left-hand portion of an IPv4 address identifies the network ID and identifies which local network the node is located on.
- The right-hand portion of an IPv4 address identifies the node ID and identifies the specific node on the local network.
- Example (n = network ID; h = node ID):
  - `10.0.1.200` (n.n.n.h)
  - `10.0.1` - Is the network ID.
  - `200` - Is the node ID.

## Special Purpose IPv4 Addresses

- Local (Node) Loopback Address
  - Range: `127.0.0.0` - `127.255.255.255`
- Private Network Addresses
  - Range: `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255`
- Private Network Addresses
  - Range: `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255`
- Private Network Addresses
  - Range: `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255`
- APIPA Addresses
  - Range: `169.254.0.0` - `169.254.255.255`

## Local (Node) Loopback Address

- The local loopback address is a special-purpose address which is used internally by the software running on a node.
- Any address beginning with (`127`) can be used by an IPv4-enabled node; however, it is almost always (`127.0.0.1`).
- The local loopback address for a node with IPv6 enabled is (`::1`).
- Every node that is IPv4-enabled has only (1) local loopback address associated with it (`127.0.0.1`).
- Every node that is IPv6-enabled has only (1) local loopback address associated with it (`::1`).
- Every node that is both IPV4 and IPv6-enabled has (2) local loopback addresses associated with it (`127.0.0.1` and `::1`).
- The local loopback address cannot be used to communicate between nodes on a network.
- It is used for local node purposes only.

## Private IPv4 Network Addresses

- Ranges:
  - `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255`
  - `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255`
  - `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255`
- Commonly found in home networks and business networks.
- IPv4 addresses in the above ranges are not routable on the Internet.
- Typically used to connect networks to the Internet by way of a NAT appliance (**NAT: Network Address Translation**).
- A NAT appliance is a node which has at least (2) IP addresses associated with it.
- One IP address is accessible via the Internet, while the other IP address is not accessible via the Internet.
- The NAT appliance is responsible for taking IP traffic and forwarding it out to the Internet or forwarding it into the private network.
- Eliminates having to configure each node with an Internet routable IPv4 address.

## APIPA Special Purpose IPv4 Addresses

- Range: `169.254.0.0` - `169.254.255.255`
- APIPA: **Automatic Private IP Addressing**
- Most nodes on a network, including the Internet, are configured to receive an IPv4 address automatically when it is powered on.
- Special nodes, called DHCP servers (DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), are responsible for issuing out IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses to nodes located on the local network.
- If by chance a node does not receive an IPv4 address automatically from a DHCP server, the node will configure itself with a randomly generated APIPA address.
- This will allow the node to communicate, but only on the local network, and only with other nodes configured in the same network range (`169.254.h.h`).

## Subnetworks

- Originally, IPv4 allowed for only (3) usable classes of networks.

1. Class A

- Range: `1.0.0.0` - `126.255.255.255` (n.h.h.h)
  - Number of Networks: _126_
  - Number of Hosts (Nodes) per Network: **16,777,214**

2. Class B
   - Range: `128.0.0.0` - `191.255.255.255` (n.n.h.h)
   - Number of Networks: _16,384_
   - Number of Hosts (Nodes) per Network: **65,534**
3. Class C
   - Range: `192.0.0.0` - `223.255.255.255` (n.n.n.h)
   - Number of Networks: _2,097,152_
   - Number of Hosts (Nodes) per Network: **254**

- The original classes of networks were a very inefficient use of the available IPv4 addresses.
- In addition, the complete range of available IPv4 addresses included several "unused" or "reserved" addresses which could not be configured on nodes.

4. Unused/Reserved

- Ranges:
  - `0.0.0.0` - `0.255.255.255`
  - `224.0.0.0` - `255.255.255.255`
- Over time, and with several advancements to the IPv4 standard, modern-day IPv4 networks now allow network administrators to break down the network ID portion into smaller, more efficient mini-networks called subnets, by using a technique called subnetting.

## Port Numbers

- For each node's IP address, there can be up to (**65,536**) unique port numbers.
- Range: `0` - `65,535`
- Port numbers are used by software applications and services to process the received data.
- Port numbers are associated with a unique IP address.
- Therefore, a node with multiple IP addresses can use the same port number for different applications or services, as long as they are bound to a different IP address.
- Some common port numbers include:
  - `80`, `443` - Used for web browsing.
  - `25`, `110`, `143` - Used for sending and receiving e-mail messages.
- To connect to a node which includes (1) network adapter, and (3) unique IP addresses bound to it, there are potentially (**196,608**) unique possible ways to do so.
  - 1 x 3 x 65,536 = 196,608
- To connect to a node which includes (3) network adapters, and (2) unique IP addresses bound to each, there are potentially (**393,216**) unique possible ways to do so.
  - 3 x 2 x 65,536 = 393,216
- To connect to a node which includes (1) network adapter, and (200) unique IP addresses bound to it, there are potentially (**13,107,200**) unique possible ways to do so.
  - 1 x 200 x 65,536 = 13,107,200
- Port numbers are associated with software (applications or services) running on a node.
- Examples:
  - **80** - Unsecured web browsing (http)
  - **443** - Secured web browsing (https)
  - **25** - Unsecured/secured sending of e-mail messages (smtp/smtp-s)
  - **110** - Unsecured/secured receiving of e-mail messages (pop/pop-s)
  - **143** - Unsecured/secured receiving of e-mail messages (imap/imap-s)
- Where:
  - **http(s)** - Hypertext Transport Protocol (Secured)
  - **smtp(-s)** - Simple Mail Transport Protocol (Secured)
  - **pop(-s)** - Post Office Protocol (Secured)
  - **imap(-s)** - Internet Message Access Protocol (Secured)
- There are (3) sub-ranges for port numbers.
- Well-known Ports (a.k.a. System Ports)
  - Range: 0 - 1,023
- Registered Ports
  - Range: 1,024 - 49,151
- Dynamic, Private, or Ephemeral Ports
  - Range: 49,152 - 65,535
- Well-known Ports (a.k.a. System Ports)
  - Port numbers which are registered with a governing body, for a specific use.
  - On all nodes, these ports should not be used on an ad hoc basis by other applications or services.
- Registered Ports
  - Port numbers which are registered with a governing body, by a software developer.
  - On most nodes, these ports can be used on an ad hoc basis, as long as they don't conflict with any other installed (and running) software applications or services which utilize the exact same port number.
- Dynamic, Private, or Ephemeral Ports
  - Port numbers which are not registered with a governing body.
  - They are used for private/custom purposes, or dynamically used by applications (short-lived).
  - Web browser applications make use of ephemeral port numbers all the time for their outbound communications to web servers.

## Subnet Mask

- The network ID portion of an IP address is determined directly by its associated subnet mask.

## Default Gateway

- The default gateway is a router network device.
- The default gateway is the only way into or out of the local network.
- Routers maintain a routing table, which identifies where other local networks are located (based on the logical IP address).
- When a router receives outgoing data, it checks its routing table to see where to send the data next (locally connected, or beyond another router device).
- Nodes configured without a default gateway (IP address) value will never communicate beyond their local network.
- Likewise, these nodes cannot be communicated with by nodes located outside of their local network.
- If data is destined for a locally connected node to the router, the MAC address of the destination node is resolved via an ARP lookup process, using the router's local ARP table.
- If, after performing an ARP lookup, the destination MAC address for the node is not found, the router sends out a broadcast to all nodes located on the local network, asking them which node is associated with the specific destination IP address.
- The node configured with that specific destination IP address responds to the router, and the router updates its local ARP table.
- Once the destination MAC address is known to the router, the router can then forward the sent data on to the destination node.

## IPv4 and IPv6 Address Resolution

- Nodes cannot communicate directly by using only MAC addresses.
  - For example: `http://01-bc-67-5d-ef-0a/`
- Humans cannot remember the dynamically changing IP addresses of each node they wish to communicate with.
  - For example: `http://206.191.26.54/`
- Human beings can, however, remember hostname values and FQDN values (Fully Qualified Domain Names).
- For example:
  - `http://hrdept/`
  - `http://hrdept.acme.com/`
- As such, name resolution is necessary to resolve human-friendly hostname and FQDN values to logical IP address values.
- Name resolution for large network environments, including the Internet, is provided by:
- DNS (Domain Name Service)
  - A distributed database infrastructure, stretched across one or more servers.
  - Performs forward lookups (hostname/FQDN value -> IP address value).
  - Performs reverse lookups (IP address value -> hostname/FQDN value).
- Name resolution for small network environments, or on an ad hoc basis, is provided by:
- Local Resolution Files
  - A text-based file located on each node, and editable by users.
  - Microsoft Windows
    - `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
  - UNIX, Linux, etc.
    - `/etc/hosts`
  - Example entries:
  ```console
  192.168.100.22  sales  sales.acme.com  server-01
  10.1.2.45       www    www.local
  ```
- Static and Dynamic IP Configuration
  - IP addressing details (IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server(s), etc.) for a node can be either manually or automatically configured.
  - Static configuration involves a user manually typing in the IP addressing details for a node.
  - With static configuration, the IP addressing details never change, unless the user manually types in different values.
  - Dynamic configuration involves the configuration of a DHCP server, where a network administrator is responsible for configuring DHCP Scopes which include the IP addressing details for all nodes on the network.
  - Nodes are then configured (only once) to receive their IP addressing details dynamically from the DHCP services located on the network.

## IP Networking Commands

### `ipconfig/netsh` (Microsoft Windows Nodes)

- Used to obtain details of the node's current IP addressing configuration.
- Examples:

```console
C:\> ipconfig -? # (Documentation for the utility)
C:\> ipconfig
C:\> ipconfig /all
C:\> netsh -? # (Documentation for the utility)
C:\> netsh interface ipv4 show addresses
```

### ifconfig (UNIX, Linux, etc. Nodes)

- Used to obtain details of the node's current IP addressing configuration.
- Example:

```console
$> ifconfig --help # (Documentation for the utility)
$> ifconfig
```

- `ping` used to:
  - Verify IP is enabled on the local node.
  - Verify IP address configuration for the local node's network adapter(s).
  - Verify remote IP connectivity to other nodes (on the local network, or beyond the default gateway).
  - Verify forward address name resolution for hostname and FQDN values (forward resolution).
  - Obtain the hostname and FQDN values for a node's known IP address (reverse resolution)
  - Populating the node's local ARP table with a recently communicated remote node

### ping (Microsoft Windows Nodes)

- Examples:

```console
C:\> ping -? (Documentation for the utility)
C:\> ping 127.0.0.1
C:\> ping 206.191.86.29
C:\> ping www.google.com
C:\> ping -4 www.google.com
C:\> ping –a 206.191.86.29
C:\> ping -4 –a 206.191.86.29
C:\> ping -6 www.google.com
C:\> ping -6 2607:f8b0:400b:80b::2004
C:\> ping -6 -a 2607:f8b0:400b:80b::2004
```

### arp (Microsoft Windows: IPv4 Only)

- Used to view the ARP table (a.k.a. MAC address table ) for a specific node
- MAC addresses are not routable; therefore, the ARP table will only include a list of MAC addresses on the same network segment as the node
- The ARP table only includes MAC addresses for nodes that have been recently communicated with
- Periodically, the ARP table automatically flushes out older MAC address information
- Examples:

```console
C:\> arp -? (Documentation for the utility)
C:\> arp –a
```

### netsh (Microsoft Windows: IPv4 or IPv6)

- Used to view the ARP table (a.k.a. MAC address table ) for a specific node
- Examples:

```console
C:\> netsh int ipv4 show neighbors
C:\> netsh int ipv6 show neighbors
```
